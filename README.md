## Description

Manage HTML5 Video quality fed across a variety of devices. A few lines of JavaScript solves the problem of video interuption. Happens when video feed is too big for 3G Network. You know what I mean. It chokes up and this utility performs the heimlic. 

## Demo

[Check out the demo](http://video.kickr.io) and disable wifi on your mobile device.

## Dependencies

[jQuery](http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8.3/jquery.min.js) is a dependency the way things are written in the repo js file, but you don't need to use jQuery if you prefer element selection and attribute manipulation in JavaScript.

## Requirements & Prerequisite Discussion

Use [Handbrake](http://handbrake.fr/downloads.php) or [Miro](http://www.getmiro.com/) to convert video.

Check out [jsconsole](http://jsconsole.com/remote-debugging.html) too.

## Usage

[Review the code and comments](http://github.com/bcardan/3gslick.js/blob/master/3gslick.js)
